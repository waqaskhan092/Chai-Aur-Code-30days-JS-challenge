# Chai-Aur-Code-30days-JS-challenge

I have started work on the "Chai-Aur-Code-30days-JS-challenge" and I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Chai Aur Code and Sir Hitesh Chaudhry for this amazing initiative. Each day, they provide new challenges that I have to solve, which is tremendously helping me in revising and understanding JavaScript in depth. The structured approach and the consistent practice are invaluable in honing my skills and deepening my knowledge of JavaScript. Thank you, Chai Aur Code and Sir Hitesh Chaudhry, for this wonderful opportunity!
